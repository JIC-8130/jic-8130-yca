### Version 0.0.1

#### New Features

You could say everything's a new feature üòù 

We're very excited to share this first version with our client, Yokogawa Corporation of America! The goal of this app is to make data collection a little easier on the team at YCA. Being a manufacturing company, YCA is very interested in making data-driven decisions. Data is at the heart of their business, and ASGARD will make it easy for them to gather, process, and share data about their company's various cost centers.

There are a lot of new features to include in this version. Highlights include:

- Line manager data input
- QA Engineer dashboard with comprehensive graph
- Detailed Cost Center data view with editable table
- Export function that creates PDF of a cost center's graph and chart
