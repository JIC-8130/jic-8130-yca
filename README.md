# jic-8130-yca

Team 8130's Junior Design project.

We are designing a desktop application for Yokogawa Corporation of America (YCA) to allow our client to track and analyze data from their assembly processes and digitize their organizational processes. YCA manufactures equipment through assembly line processes and is a leading company in producing testing, measurement, and automation materials for businesses around the world. 

### Team Conventions

Fork & Pull

- The team will follow a fork & pull model as described [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

Branches
- Two epic branches will be split from master: Track and Report
- Branches should follow the naming convention: EpicName/StoryName. Follow UpperCamelCase.

### Agile Ceremonies

- The team will participate in sprint planning (grooming) for the upcoming sprint during the last week of the current sprint.
  - This should include iterating over each story in the upcoming sprint to flesh out its acceptance criteria/definition of done, story pointing, and assigning.
- The team will participate in a retrospective during the first week after a sprint has been completed to discuss what is and is not working and develop a plan for action based on the feedback from the retrospective for the next sprint.
- The team will participate in a daily standup over Slack in the #general channel by each team member providing a summary of any work they have done, impediments they have, and work they plan to do that day.
